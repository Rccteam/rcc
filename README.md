Raspberry-PI Control Center

Menu controlled easy configuration for raspberry pi hardware installs. Primarily it's for debian sqeeze, and official raspbian distributions. Later on we hopefully we can support more operating systems, and push more tweaks, quick settings, so you can have the ability to shorten the time of recurring operations in setups.
