Raspberry-PI Control Center

Ncurses based menu controlled (inspired by menuconfig) easy configuration for raspberry pi hardware installs. Primarily it's for debian sqeeze, and official raspbian distributions. Later on hopefully we can support more operating systems, and push more tweaks, quick settings, so you can have the ability to shorten the time of recurring operations in setups. It contains wide spectrum of setups, and settings, that can ease admins, and users life. Hopefully you enjoy it.
